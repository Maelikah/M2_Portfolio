##   📝 Description

---

</br>

This webpage has been created to store my apps portfolio. 

The main purpose of this was to apply the concepts learned during the second week of the bootcamp. Particularly those related to Flexbox and responsiveness using media queries.

This was a hard challenge to me as I had to investigate a lot to make the contents look like the mockup. I still have some doubts related to flexbox concepts, however reverse engineering similar pages helped me. I will continue to study this topic on my own to try to master it.
